## Introduction

There are LOTS of React Tutorials and videos all around the internet.
While I generally prefer to work through a good textbook (e.g. [React In
Action](https://www.manning.com/books/react-in-action)) I instead came
across the [Digital Ocean Community Tutorial Serices How To Code in
React.js](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-react-js).
This together with the [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/) and
the documentation for [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
has been my starting point for React.

This repository is a sample of an implemenation of one of the tutorials.
